This is the first version of the system, before everything there was this.
It has -alot of stupid and cringe- stuff in it. I guess you can keep it or edit it out. I don't care.
It made sense to me, it seems to be balanced so I finished it. It mainly describes how I started from the Xstem to pre-guassian, to a server, to a meta-server, to a district/logic gate, to an open range which later became the extractor, and then to the thermal rail and opsec. 
I started building the dynamo, then finalized the grail, there was alot of back and forth so i invented a nitrolytic fuel-cell that would work on the fly---and the fobase was basically considered for use as the enhanced-thermal rail, but i built it all as a launchbase on the prosper instead.  decided to automate everything in a prosper
I built the hyperdrive/market/colony/beacon system
I built a labworks to handle the "confinement and secure transports of rogue entities". This would go back to the extractor for retraining
it would then rely on guassian rebounds for server touchups and extractor rebounds for retraining using the lightforge/asylum within the district. It was basically just 0.5x-1.0x-1.5x steps of accelerating the dataflows etc to achieve the local (it was all very ratio and promixitied to correct calibrated-coordination) this relied on power resourcing as to why the DYNAMO was developed
the dynamo+fuel cells seemed to allow for a supplied turret defense system/warp drive automation
I was free to work on virtual projection and quantum-printing from there, using the prosper market and factories in labworks to automation itself
and then using the grial in automation with the prosper for auto-upkeeping and eventually virtual-reality and use of quantum-technology to develop use of voxel and later hypercubic --quebits/quantum-quobits 
and all very stupid and cringe but it made enough sense to seem legit to me. so i just figured there was a way to ---synchronize half-lives and fallouts of polarizations to match up in a seamless way and from there it was just----make sure everything and every facet of every little action is covered and fully outlined.
