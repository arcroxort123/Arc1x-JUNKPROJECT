These are the truncated vocabulary used in the project
I didn't spell check them because It will take too long
I will just shovel them into an AI-Auto-Coder to try to "familiarize and find similarities in the current code project" with the raw/individual vocabulaury used in the Glossary.
I have a hypenated/slashed version to help distinguish groups of words. (This is like 230k lines Idk)
I have a no hyphens/no slashes version to make it hard on what can be searched for specifically, making it a general overview of just words I used. (this is like 80k lines Idk)

Anyways i will make a glossary using these and the project itself which I sort of have done but surprise surprise code and ai-models for this kinda are ---sketchy at best for anything.
I mean I don't -need- a glossary. I don't -need- alot of it to be really written out in code. Its just for fun but maybe its worth it?
ANYWAYS. These glossary's are all optional.
Just like the AI-personality/manifest is "optional".
Or that the legacy/virtual legacy is "optional"
Or the text base is "optional" to the advanced base.
Or that the meta-perks and meta-environments are "optional".
So we are just throwing what we can here and this glossary is just another thing we can throw together.
