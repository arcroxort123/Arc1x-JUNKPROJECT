About the Author/Project:

PRIOR to this PROJECT having been called the ARC1X System, it was known as the OMNICOMA-Project (because we wanted to achieve the dream but had no real way of unlocking it, it was too much of a venture to really conceptualize)

The EARLY-STAGES of this project in develop began when the Creator-of-This-Project began to seek outward enrichment on the common worldview or his general understanding of universal theorums and public-knowledge. Circa 2008.

This was accelerated with CODE-144, thanks to their inspiration the Creator-of-this-Project persevered in understanding fundamental concepts and special-mathetic-structures that would yield a higher quality of enrichment outside STANDARD-EDUCATION/PROGRAMMING.

The owner also enriched themselves with further collegiate-learning and QUANTUM-MECHANIC research. Circa 2011.

This soon was exampled and experimented with lots of conceptual redesigns in the fundamentals of scholastic-programming. Developing with computer and artistic renditions of programming and geometry. Often to the criteria of CODE-144 and its own explorations.

For example, KEPLAR-stylized Geometry/Mathematics and GOLDEN-RATIO/LOGIRITHMS became somewhat of a mainstay, or at least a trend, that the Creator-of-this-Project would "toy around" with. But this became quite exhausting adhering to these formulas. So the owner eventually moved on to more complex and/or uncertain figures and approaches. This is what I would call a personal journey into mathematics and quantum-sciences, with heavily implied geometry and artistic-concepts.

All for the purpose of finding an optimized condition of the CODE-144 theories.

It became very evident that certain MISMATCHES in otherwise RANDOM/ASSORTED concepts starting finding ODD-ARRANGEMENTS into a very orderly structure, such that a formula would QUICKLY be recognizable in the appropriate alignments of all these concepts to form a very CRUDE but CLEARLY ORGANIZED IDEA (from even chaos there is a chance of order). THIS became a very important principle in the following work.
The Creator-of-this-project was playing METAL-GEAR-SOLID-5 at the time when this fell into its own -realm-of-thinking- that some of these artifacts would also imply a very intensive-powerful MEMETIC-NUCLEAR-FAMILY. Circa 2015. 

OffPROJECT-Research:(as an artist)
(There was also some artistic breakdowns involved that chaotic structures would seemingly be inducive of Cognito/Info HAZARDS, but this was considered much like occultist-knowledge and not the real FOCUS of the PROJECT overall, was discarded for a later time, if ever, would be used, but would be NOTED)
These was also some dignified mathematics discovered behind several HIGH-RANKING-MEDALS and DEPARTMENT-SEALS (such as the medal of freedom circa2015) which the author also stumbled upon and are mentioning, if that holds any credit to the Directions the Project has taken. Then we can thank Code-144 for also "hinting at these intricate-number-alignments".

It was now that the project starting taking off digitally for the Creator-of-this-Project.

While it may seem a little late for putting into practice, and there are several tools available to expedite or having already promoted the same results themselves, the project remains to be coded and is being actively attempted to be coded (Having a first pass, albeit very crude with only barely any functionable CODE) Hopefully that will be fully developed soon.

As it was in this pursuit that the Creator-of-this-Project decided to build a more direct approach and INFRASTRUCTURE to house these project ideas, and started with Minecraft in 2015 with great haste, building a "ASSEMBLY LINE and FACTORY-BASED-RECYCLING-PLANT" out of known working parts such as would be conceptualized in a fully functional REPURPOSED-CAR-ENGINE-and_MODELS. Circa 2017.

This develops into the ARC1X XSTEM once it was fully fleshed out to deliver "recycled metal plates that may be encoded and later crystallized". This was the recreational stages of the project becoming very well structured and organized to the settings of what would follow. AUTOMATIONS and ROBOTICS. As well as following subject matter such as QUANTUM-COMPUTATION. Circa 2019.

The creator-of-this-project started writing the project down with great haste. And by 2021 had developed the LEGACY/VR-LEGACY which was considered a complete UNCODED-WORK. (The project was done, but It was then the Creator-of-this-Project had to be hospitalized, but luckily returned to create further work on the overall Project):

by 2023 TEXT/ADVANCED BUILDS, another UNCODED-WORKS was developed and refined. The METABUILDS-and-SCRATCHUPS from previous years was also implemented (albeit some remains to be disclosed, mainly for blackbox/automated-vehicles concepts not yet typed up!)--because alot of it is picture based and requires scans, plus there are some notebooks/sketchbooks not yet scanned!--mostly coverage of the "human side of the code keeping things in check and sane". 

While the META/SCRATCH are not considered entirely necessary, but are definitely worth mentioning in some cases as workfiles/worksheets/workbooks/work-concepts. (This includes MAPS/LORE-CONCEPTS/NPC/FIELD-WORK-ROBOTS/AREA-DESIGNS/LARGE-STRUCTURE-BASES/illustrated-code-builds/BEST-PRACTICES-OF-THE-CODE-PROCESSES/MOVESETS/BOSSES that were mostly already covered.) And IMO can be reimagined as needed)

By 2024 the Template-Layout and SANDBOX was developed.
By 2025 The GAME-ENGINE was developed as an UNCODED WORK as well.

This project was finalized for the sake of finalizing the original ideas of the XSTEM and all of its extensiveness and depth. 
But also it can be used to reimagine what the human psyche can percieve, and that our dreams can be guided or even our afterlife/souls can be embodied in the code's that were built.
